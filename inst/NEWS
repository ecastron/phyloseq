* Allow multi-class tests with mt()

v0.99.20
===========
* Added "GlobalPatterns" dataset, and some other minor improvements

  examples. More examples will be added to the vignette.
* add getVariable accessor function, for streamlining access
  to values/vectors/factors/etc of the variates contained in
  the sampleData component
* revise documentation about parallelization of import_biom()
* revise documentation for enterotype dataset

v0.99.19
===========
* fixed a bug in general import() function in which it properly processed import command, but then failed to return result.

v0.99.18
===========
* Added import_biom() function to import BIOM format OTU-clustered data / metadata
* Added (direct) dependency for plyr, as well as RJSONIO 


phyloseq 0.4.2 - 0.4.7
===========

* Improvements to import_mothur() via import_mothur_otulist().
* merge_samples() function added, in preparation for hypergeometric (fisher.test) test wrapper.
* Fixed bug in merge_phyloseq() for certain combinations of objects. 
* Various other fixes and improvements.

phyloseq 0.4.1
===========

* First official submission to Bioconductor
* Includes many build-fixes, bug-fixes
